Howdy! Welcome to some simple tools for comparing protein accession data to the absolute copy numbers of the proteins identified. 
What you should do is just go to the Shiny App on Shiny.io at this link : https://proteomicsnews.shinyapps.io/copynumber_plotter/
And you should download the ProteomicRulerData for HeLa from Bekker-Jennsen et al., Cell Systems which I've simplified to a CSV. 
You can download it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ehJUwkDJQ4GgFVUwTc_io6Nbr3lPbp_g/view?usp=sharing
For comparison here are the two files used in figure 5 of the manuscript for this program! 
The first is the proteins identified by a 60min BOXCAR Run. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jsk68Tw_lrAn-FHFWpQCqxCicDMPCpr1/view?usp=sharing)
and here is the same file if you search it without match between runs using an EXTENSIVE HeLa digest library on the same instrument using the exact same conditions:
